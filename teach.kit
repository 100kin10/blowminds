						// You should mostly be able to copy and paste the Google form into _teach-form.kit if you make any changes. Just take what they

						// manually if you want it in there. The name field is actually two fields, so you'll want to delete the second one, add its <input>
						// immediately after the other <input>, and give it's parent div.ss-form-entry name element an additional class of "name."

						// We also have some custom stuff on the bottom, so copy the code below starting with <div class="ss-item ss-navigate"> and going

          <h2>Teachers are heroes. These links tell their origin stories.</h2>
          <p>Chances are you’ve hardly, barely, only just begun to even consider the notion of teaching. So here are some resources to better understand what a teaching career requires/entails.</p>
          <div id="learn-more-links">
            <li>Campaign partner WNET <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZDZy17guUpDgyN0c4MXqw">interviewed real, live teachers</a> to detail their classroom experiences. There’s really no alternative to hearing actual teachers talk about their lives.</li>

            <li>Another partner, ElevatED, has <a target="_blank" href="http://teachelevated.org/explore-teaching/teacher-fit-quiz/">17 questions to help you gauge your interest in teaching</a>. Consider this the earnestly helpful equivalent of this website’s homepage quiz.</li>

            <li>After watching <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFTNBLptPsM">30 seconds of inspiration</a>, you can visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teach.org/">Teach.org</a> for heaps of info on scholarships, job listings, and what it takes to get into a classroom.</li>

            <li>New York City’s Department of Education compiled <a target="_blank" href="http://schools.nyc.gov/TeachNYC/nyc/stem">one hub for all things STEM teaching</a> in the nation’s biggest public school system.</li>

            <li>The <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/_2GBVzoVNbE">subject of this video is an English teacher</a>, but he clearly blows minds. There’s no way you watch this without gaining a deeper appreciation for teachers.</li>

            <li>We created this Facebook group—<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/846756655337613/">Current And Future STEM Teachers United For Good Things</a>—so you could tap into a community of people able to answer questions, dispel myths, and become your friends.</li>
