This program offers: 
Admission to a master's degree program at a well-established partner university
Extensive preparation for teaching in a high-need urban or rural secondary school for one full year prior to becoming the teacher-of-record in a science or math classroom
A $30,000 stipend (Once Fellows are certified teachers at the end of the first year, they obtain salaried employment in high-need schools.)
Support and mentoring throughout the three-year teaching commitment

Their ideal recruit: 
Has, or expects to have by June 30, 2015, a STEM bachelor's degree from an accredited U.S. college or university or international equivalent
Has a cumulative undergraduate grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale 

What makes them special is:
The full school year of intensive clinical preparation in a high-need urban/rural classroom, like the ones where Fellows will ultimately teach.
Not only financial support ($30,000), but also three years of ongoing "double mentoring" from both the Fellow's university and the school where s/he is teaching.
