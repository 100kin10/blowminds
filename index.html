							<h2>Let’s Catch You Up</h2>
							<img src="images/obama.gif"/>
							<p>Our story begins with the President. Of the nation. As in, <a href="http://youtu.be/9ZdEmjtF6HE?t=21m44s">Barack Obama.</a> Specifically his 2011 State Of The Union Address in which he called for 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. </p>

							<p>That direct challenge from the leader of the free world led to the formation of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.100kin10.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFH0zsJmjWKLwrRXeOHcb10CVAGxA">100Kin10</a>, a non-profit with more than 150 partner organizations. In the fall of 2013 they hatched a plan to brand this entire movement in a way that spoke more directly to the young, smart STEM majors who will become many of those 100,000 new teachers. The goal was to have partners chip in to create something bigger and more amazing than any one of them could accomplish on their own. </p>

							<p>That’s where <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cultivatedwit.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHN6HH1vd5RDR0Gs13NSptcoC6xxA">Cultivated Wit</a> comes in. They are a creative agency that uses comedy, technology, and design to tell stories, build community, and teach. They put in a bid to lead that branding effort, and most certainly didn’t blackmail anybody to win it. </p>

							<p>Now everybody is married and 30+ partners have contributed money and flatware to help them begin their life together. This fall, they are expecting to birth a beautiful recruitment campaign. Okay, this metaphor is getting uncomfortable…</p>

							<h2>YOUR DAILY GRIND COULD BLOW A MIND</h2>
							<img src="images/thumbsup.gif"/>
							<p>Now for the fun part.</p>

							<p>The real magic of teaching is packed into the moment when a kid “gets it.” That moment of not just learning, but truly understanding. Any teacher knows the look that sweeps over a kid’s face when their mind is blown. And no subjects are more mind blowing than STEM, meaning no subject sizzles more synapses than a STEM teacher. </p>

							<p>This campaign will create a pile of assets that drive this point home: Minds Don’t Blow Themselves. Videos, GIFs, infographics, tweets, and physical paper products that people can then photograph and post on Instagram… Distributing fun and engaging content will be the first step in uncovering the next generation of fun and engaging teachers. </p>

							<p>That pile of assets will lead people back to a website that connects all the fun stuff back to the overall mission. It will emphasize the long term positive impact of teaching, and help young people realize that becoming a teacher is more attainable than they may realize. Part of that last step is executing an effective handoff from this campaign over to teaching programs that can actually move the needle on our goal for 100,000 excellent new teachers. </p>

							<p>See, it’s easy. I mean, except for the hours of writing and designing and animating and programming and finding distribution partners and scheduling flights to D.C. to receive congratulations from the President, but we still have all summer for that. </p>
